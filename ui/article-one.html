                <div><p> C functions are used to avoid rewriting same logic/code again and again in a program.
There is no limit in calling C functions to make use of same functionality wherever required.
We can call functions any number of times in a program and from any place in a program.
A large C program can easily be tracked when it is divided into functions.
The core concept of C functions are, re-usability, dividing a big task into small pieces to achieve the functionality and to improve understandability of very large C programs.</p></div>
